# GPIO_DeviceDriver_STM32F446re
Created a device driver code for accesssing GPIO pin particularly for STM32F446re microcontroller, but it can be used for most of ARM 32bit microcontroller boards by some changes.
You can include this as library file by  #include<gpio_driver.h>
The main file is for your reference, about how you can make use of the defined function in the library.
